# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas

I am a physics-driven engineering student deeply passionate about **fundamental physics**,  
with a strong attraction to **quantum theory, quantum electrodynamics (QED)** and the way abstract models
become concrete through **mathematics and numerical simulations**.

I enjoy taking the time to understand physical phenomena from first principles,  
then translating them into code to explore their behavior beyond analytical limits.

## 🧠 Background & mindset

🎓 I am currently a 2nd year engineering student at Telecom Physique Strasbourg!
-> I also follow a specific formation for my double-degree program : the Master's degree of Quantum Technologies, European Program with the University of Strasbourg.

My academic interests naturally gravitate toward:
- fundamental quantum mechanics
- quantum field theory & QED
- mathematical structures underlying physical theories
- numerical approaches as a bridge between theory and reality

I am particularly interested in environments where **theoretical understanding and practical work** interact.

## 👨‍🚀 What I enjoy working on

- Fundamental quantum physics and formalism  
- Quantum Computation  
- Analytic problems related to physics  
- Numerical simulation of physical equations  
- Understanding limitations, stability and artifacts of numerical schemes  

I do not approach physics as a checklist of skills, but as a **long-term intellectual pursuit**.

## Selected project

### 🌊 Wave propagation on a disk — *WaveOnDisk*
Numerical simulation of wave propagation on a circular domain using finite difference methods.

This project explores:
- wave dynamics on bounded geometries
- stability conditions of numerical schemes
- dispersion, phase shifts and numerical artifacts
- comparison with analytical expectations (Bessel functions, symmetry considerations)


🔗 Repository: https://github.com/ThomasFRZK/WaveOnDisk-MATLAB

**Tools & concepts**:  
MATLAB · Python · finite differences · PDEs · wave physics · numerical stability

I primarily use **Python and MATLAB** for physics and simulations,  
and I am comfortable working in **C / C++** when closer control is needed.

## 📚 Currently exploring

- Advanced quantum mechanics (spin technologies, quantum systems of atoms and light, etc.)
- Foundations of quantum field theory and QED
- Numerical methods applied to physical systems
- Quantum computing from a **physics-first perspective**

## 🌍 Looking ahead

I am open to **research-oriented internships and R&D environments**  
(UK, also Germany, Sweden, Netherlands),  
with a long-term goal of pursuing a **PhD**, then contributing to research or advanced R&D in quantum science.
